The goal is to build a LLM-powered program that use RAG to optimize generating output for the questions related to a resume 
Here is the step to do that 

### 1. PDF to Image Conversion
- **Objective**: Convert PDF resumes into image formats (e.g., PNG). This step addresses the instability and variability issues often encountered when directly processing diverse PDF structures with Python PDF handling libraries. By converting to images, we create a more consistent and reliable input for subsequent text extraction.

### 2. Text Extraction and Header Identification from Images
- **Objective**: Extract textual content from the generated resume images. Simultaneously, identify key headers within the extracted text. These headers are crucial for structuring the resume content, enabling more effective chunking and organization of information.

### 3. Text Chunking
- **Objective**: Divide the extracted and structured text into smaller, manageable chunks based on the identified headers. This process ensures that each chunk contains semantically related information, which is vital for the accuracy and relevance of information retrieval.

### 4. Embedding Generation
- **Objective**: Convert the text chunks into numerical vector embeddings. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of each chunk, allowing for efficient similarity searches and comparisons within a vector database.

### 5. Vector Database Setup and Storage
- **Objective**: Establish a vector database to store the generated embeddings. This database will facilitate rapid storage and retrieval of resume chunks, serving as the foundation for the RAG system.

### 6. Retrieval Function for Context Preparation
- **Objective**: Develop a retrieval function that, given a user query, identifies and fetches the top 3 most relevant chunks from the vector database. This function is critical for preparing the most pertinent context to be fed into the Large Language Model (LLM).

### 7. LLM Integration for Response Generation
- **Objective**: Integrate a Large Language Model (LLM) that utilizes the retrieved context to generate accurate and relevant responses to user queries. The RAG approach ensures that the LLM's output is grounded in the specific information contained within the resume, enhancing the quality and reliability of the generated answers.
